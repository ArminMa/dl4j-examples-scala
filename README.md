Deeplearning4J Examples for Scala
=========================

 This project is a simple Scala porting of [deeplearning4j-example](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples).

The main purpose of this project is:

* Show example of how to use deeplearning4j Java API from scala

* Provide a sbt project template depends on DL4J


Every examples in this demonstration directly calls Java APIs of DL4J.
If you strongly want to write codes in the scala manner,
you should consider to use [deeplearning4s](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4s).
